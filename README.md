A Discord.js bot to help with arranging raids and get D2 character stats inside Discord.

## Contributing
Currently I'm rewriting the bot on branch `refactor-2` so that it's more modular and easier to maintain.  Any PRs should be submitted to that branch.  Coding guidlines are as follows:  
1) Single quotes for strings, or backticks where template literals are used
2) 2 spaces for indents
3) Semicolons are your friend
4) Early-returns > nested ifs
